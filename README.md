# Keylogging Project

This is a simple yet powerful keylogger application built with Python and Tkinter. It provides a user-friendly graphical interface to start and stop the logging of keystrokes. All captured data is saved locally for educational and monitoring purposes.

---

## Description

The application captures all keyboard events when active and saves them into two separate log files: a plain text file (`key_log.txt`) for easy reading and a structured JSON file (`key_log.json`) for detailed analysis of key presses, holds, and releases. The GUI provides clear status indicators, real-time statistics, and easy controls for managing the keylogging process.

## Features

* **Graphical User Interface**: An intuitive GUI built with Tkinter for easy operation.
* **Start/Stop Functionality**: Simple buttons to start and stop the keylogger at any time.
* **Dual Log Format**: Saves logs in both human-readable `.txt` and machine-readable `.json` formats.
* **Real-time Status**: A visual indicator shows whether the keylogger is currently `ACTIVE` or `INACTIVE`.
* **Keystroke Counter**: Displays the total number of key events recorded during a session.
* **Easy Log Access**: A "View Logs" button that opens the output directory (`/out`) directly in the system's file explorer.
* **Cross-Platform**: Designed to run on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
