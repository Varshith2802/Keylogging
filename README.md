# Keylogging Project

This is a simple yet powerful keylogger application built with Python and Tkinter. It provides a user-friendly graphical interface to start and stop the logging of keystrokes. All captured data is saved locally for educational and monitoring purposes.

---

## Description

[cite_start]The application captures all keyboard events when active and saves them into two separate log files: a plain text file (`key_log.txt`) for easy reading and a structured JSON file (`key_log.json`) for detailed analysis of key presses, holds, and releases[cite: 5]. [cite_start]The GUI provides clear status indicators, real-time statistics, and easy controls for managing the keylogging process[cite: 5].

## Features

* [cite_start]**Graphical User Interface**: An intuitive GUI built with Tkinter for easy operation[cite: 5].
* [cite_start]**Start/Stop Functionality**: Simple buttons to start and stop the keylogger at any time[cite: 5].
* [cite_start]**Dual Log Format**: Saves logs in both human-readable `.txt` and machine-readable `.json` formats[cite: 5].
* [cite_start]**Real-time Status**: A visual indicator shows whether the keylogger is currently `ACTIVE` or `INACTIVE`[cite: 5].
* [cite_start]**Keystroke Counter**: Displays the total number of key events recorded during a session[cite: 5].
* [cite_start]**Easy Log Access**: A "View Logs" button that opens the output directory (`/out`) directly in the system's file explorer[cite: 5].
* [cite_start]**Cross-Platform**: Designed to run on Windows, macOS, and Linux[cite: 5].
